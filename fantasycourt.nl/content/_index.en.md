# What is Fantasy Court?
##### Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival that is focused on the unique and somewhat niche culture surrounding fantasy and LARP (Live Action Role Playing). This festival has a vast array of stalls, associations, and activities that all fall under the purview of the awesome world of fantasy. This includes LARP associations, surprising board games, exotic foods, a LARP sword fighting tournament, LARP sword fighting for kids, storytellers, and a LARP archery range, as well as a wide variety of stalls that sell fantasy-related wares. We offer all that belongs in the world of fantasy, and anything that will make you feel part of that world.

# Date and Location

Fantasy Court takes place on the 8th of June on the Koeveld on the campus of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The festival is free to visit. The festival terrain is open and does not require a ticket or reservation. Whether you are a student or not, a parent with children or coming on your own, there will be something organized for everyone. Would you like to know more?
