Vendor and other organisation applications are now open. You can find more information on the [vendor page]({{< ref "/standhouders" >}}) or apply directly using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgNXPGttfaqPzkXfZpr1McJyhMBjCHTCpDKVrfEfgqgnLUFQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Fantasy Court will happen this year on the 8th of June on the Koeveld at the TU/e Eindhoven. 

On request of the vendors, we have brought the application period forward. The first round of selections closes on the 12th of January. If you apply before this date, you will receive confirmation whether you have been selected in week 3 or 4 of 2025. For people who apply later, there is a second round of selections in March.

If you have any questions or need to have earlier confirmation because of extenuating circumstances, you can always [mail us](mailto:info@fantasycourt.nl) to see what is possible.

Additionally, we are always looking for fun activities, workshops or recommendations for performers we should book. If you have any ideas, feel free to send them our way. 

Are you unsure which category your organisation belongs to? Please send us [an email](mailto:info@fantasycourt.nl) so we can help you.

Please make sure to read our [registration regulations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWsQuVgl0SjMx5kb9iwUHwva5-iMHPq9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118033485815882455862&rtpof=true&sd=true) which can also be found in the form. By applying to be a part of our festival, you automatically agree to these conditions.
