## King's Day
Last Saturday we were at the King's day market to promote Fantasy Court. It was very busy and we saw a lot of people passing by. Hopefully we will see you all at Fantasy Court. After a day of hard work and the necessary muscle pain from the harness, it is time to continue with the preparations for the festival.

Below are a few more photos:
