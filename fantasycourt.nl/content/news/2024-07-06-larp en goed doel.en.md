### Books4Life
Books4Life is a charity book shop with an enormous collection of fantasy and science fiction, as well as dedicated volunteers to provide information and advice about their offerings. Come enjoy their broad selection and shockingly favorable prices! The proceeds from Books4Life are donated to various good-works organisations, such as Amnesty International and Oxfam Novib. Books4Life also supports local charities such as Armoede Fonds, Soep&Co, Caritas and Buurtgezinnen. 

### Toys in the Attic
Toys in the Attic organises several larps which take place in one interconnected setting. These larps range from fantasy to steampunk to post-apocalyptic in theme. All of their larps hebben focus heavily on drama and intrigue - players may make difficult choices, and must choose their friends carefully. 

### LRP Ravenskeep Adventures
Two times each year, Ravenskeep organises a large larp event in North Brabant. The event distinguishes itself through high quality for a low price in order to offer an event that is as accessible as possible. Ravenskeep also organises some smaller events in between their main events on the initiative of the players. 
Ravenskeep is a city within the world of Mordath where the larp takes place. This city continually draws attention from both good and evil entities due to a hidden power source. As a player, you possess the ability to protect the city, but also the possibility to be the cause of its ruin.
