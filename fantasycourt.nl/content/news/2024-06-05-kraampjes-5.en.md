### 🗡️Vonkenstaal 🔨
Vonkenstaal is the promotional name for metalworks made by the blacksmith Dylan Dijkstra. He primarily makes knives and tools, but occasionally also makes steel flowers and coat racks. Pay a visit to this smith's stall and be amazed by the craftsmanship on display!

### 🎲The Wandering Merchant ✨
What began as a small hobby has gradually grown into a passionate business. The Wandering Merchant sells handmade leatherwork with RPG, larp and cosplay themes. Pouches, dice trays, weapon holders, and other accessories are all on offer.
