{{< /message >}}

Dear fantasy fans,
It took a bit longer than expected, but we managed to reserve the field. Fantasy Court will take place on the 8th of June from 11:00 to 18:00, on the TU/e campus as always.

We have been busy in the background and the website is getting updates again. We have just updated most of the information. This will be a temporary update as we are looking into a redesign together with a new style for the festival. 

Furthermore, we are on the longlist for the fantasy awards. It would be really cool if a small volunteer-driven event like Fantasy Court could be nominated for the shortlist. You can help us with this by [nominating us here](fantasy-awards.nl ). 

The committee has been getting some new faces, which is good for the future of the festival.
