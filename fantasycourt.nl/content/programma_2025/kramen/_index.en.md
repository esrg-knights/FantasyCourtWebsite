### [E.S.R.G. Knights of the Kitchen Table](https://kotkt.nl/)
Eindhovens Studenten Rollenspel Genootschap Knights of the Kitchen Table, or simply the Knights, is Eindhoven's one and only student board- and roleplaying game association. Are you crazy about board games, or do you enjoy letting your imagination run free in a roleplaying game? Then you've come to the right place!

Each week we play several board games - well-known board games such as Catan and Ticket to Ride, but also more obscure games like Race for the Galaxy, Big Book of Madness, Kingsburg, Terraforming Mars and around 250 other games are all available for our members to play.

We also support various roleplaying game campaigns and hold a monthly one-shot roleplaying evening. Not only the famous Dungeons and Dragons, but also Pathfinder, Blades in the Dark, World of Darkness, and many more.

All of this is based in our own association space, in the Luna building on the TU/e campus. In the Knights room, members often play a board game or a tabletop roleplaying session, do their homework, or just hang out, in the afternoons as well as evenings.

### [De Zwaardkring](https://www.zwaardkring.nl/)
De Zwaardkring is a foundation that gives lessons in H.E.M.A. through all of Brabant. H.E.M.A. stands for 'Historical European Martial Arts' and is a sport based in historical combat practices. In short, it involves training in swordfighting the same way they did in the Middle Ages!

As practitioners of historical combat arts, we want to come as close as possible to the context of traditional swordfighting. We do this by studying original manuscripts from those times, interpreting the techniques, and finally applying them through full-contact sparring. We use blunt swords and all necessary protective gear to make sure safety is guaranteed.
Do you want to know more about how to fight with a sword, or do you want to experience it once for yourself? Come have a look at what we do! And hopefully we'll also see you again during one of our lessons. Our workshops at Fantasy Court are only for adults over 18 years old.
