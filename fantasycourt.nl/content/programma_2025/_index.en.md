# Program Edition 2025
Fantasy court 2025 takes place on Sunday the 8th of June from 11.00 to 18.00. We are currently busy assembling the program which will be published here as soon as we are ready.

# Confirmed Artists

We are currently looking for artists to perform on Fantasy Court. If you are interested in performing feel free to [mail us](mailto:fc@kotkt.nl).

# Confirmed Activities

Currently the following activities have been confirmed:

### On the Tournament Field
Several activities and demonstrations will take place on the tournament field:
- **LARP Swordfighting Tournament**: An exciting 1-on-1 tournament for all levels of experience! Can you win the grand prize? Attendance is free for all participants.

### On the stage
- **Costume Competition:** Bring your finest fantasy garment creations and dazzle the jury with your skills! Note: this is not necessarily a cosplay competition, but we do not exclude cosplays.

### Activity corner
In the world of fantasy, there is not only a lot to see, but also many activities you can participate in.
- **NERF Shooting Range:** A game created by Fantasy Court volunteers. Compete with your friends in this game of NERF dart shooting which tests your accuracy and speed. Can you pass the darts through the gates before they close?
- **LARP Plushie Archery:** Our classic 'stuffed animal archery' game. Shoot soft foam arrows at cuddly toys and keep whichever you manage to hit!
- **Various Outdoor Games:** We'll have plenty of simple field games open all day, such as Kubb.
- **Larps:** Our lovely LARPS 'Toys in the Attic' and Ravenskeep have returned and will be hosting some fun activities for you! Toys in the Attic will hand out quests for you to complete and Ravenskeep will play a sport from their larp.
