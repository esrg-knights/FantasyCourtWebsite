## Larp Swordfighting Tournament

An exciting 1-on-1  LARP-swordfighting tournament for all experience levels! Will you take home a first place win? Participation is free for all visitors. Due to high interest, participants must register in advance. You can register on-site on the day of the festival at the Fantasy Court info stand. This year we will once again have a beautiful prize for the winners.

### Tournament Rules Summary
 * The tournament is based on 1-v-1 duels within an elimination bracket structure.
 * The tournament will use LARP swords provided by the student association ESRG Knights of the Kitchen Table so that everyone fights using the same type of sword.
 * The goal is to score strikes on your opponent without being struck yourself.
 * Each duel is won by the first person to score 5 points or more from strikes while in the lead by 2 points or more.
 * If no one has won a duel in the first two minutes, the person with the most points wins the duel.
 * There are no rules related to armor.
 * Cheating is not permitted.

A complete list of rules can be found [here]({{< ref "/programma_2025/activiteiten/toernooiregels" >}}) as well as posted on-site at the festival.

## Costume Competition
Bring your finest fantasy garment creations and dazzle the jury with your skills! As an important note, this competition revolves around handmade costume pieces, and not who has bought the most beautiful outfit. This is not necessarily a cosplay competition, but we do not exclude cosplays.

## Activity Corner
In the world of fantasy, there is not only a lot to see, but also many activities to enjoy as a participant!
- **NERF Shooting Range**: A game created by Fantasy Court volunteers. Compete with your friends in this game of NERF dart shooting which tests your accuracy and speed. Can you pass the darts through the gates before they close?
- **Larp Plushie Archery**: Our classic ‘stuffed animal archery’ game, previously featured during our King's Day event. Shoot soft foam arrows at cuddly toys and keep whichever you manage to hit!
- **Various Outdoor Games**: We’ll have plenty of field games open all day, such as Kubb.
