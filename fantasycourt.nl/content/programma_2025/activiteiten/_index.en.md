## Larp Swordfighting Tournament

An exciting 1-on-1  LARP-swordfighting tournament for all experience levels! Will you take home a first place win? Participation is free for all visitors.

This year we will once again have a beautiful prize for the winners.

### Tournament Rules Summary
 * The tournament is based on 1-v-1 duels within an elimination bracket structure.
 * The tournament will use LARP swords provided by the student association ESRG Knights of the Kitchen Table so that everyone fights using the same type of sword.
 * The goal is to score strikes on your opponent without being struck yourself.
 * Each duel is won by the first person to score 5 points or more from strikes while in the lead by 2 points or more.
 * If no one has won a duel in the first two minutes, the person with the most points wins the duel.
 * There are no rules related to armor.
 * Cheating is not permitted.

## Travelling frog trader
Come by and visit the travelling frog trader! They have come bringing all sorts of things from their adventures. If you have something to trade, then they would love to give you something in return! 
Luckily for anyone who doesn't have anything to trade: this year there will also be a grabbelton at the Fantasy Court info stand, full of nice trinkets. Surely there will be a worthy item among them to trade with this mysterious merchant.

## Balfolk workshop
There will be a free balfolk workshop. Balfolk is a dance style based on traditional French and Dutch dances. In the workshop, the participants will learn a number of these dances, and thereafter will be able to dance them together. You can check the start time in the [programme schedule.]({{< ref "/programma_2025/" >}})
