### On the Tournament Field
Several activities and demonstrations will take place on the tournament field:
- **LARP Sword fighting Tournament:** An exciting 1-on-1 tournament for all levels of experience! Can you win the grand prize? Participation is free for all participants.
- **Historical sword fighting demonstration:** Throughout the day, the Zwaardkring shall be present to give demonstrations in historical sword fighting. They will explain about the medieval art of sword fighting, their weapons and much more. Do not shy away from asking them about their sport!

### On the stage

- **Costume Competition:** In the morning at the info stand, you will be able to sign up for the costume competition! Wear your finest fantasy clothing creations and dazzle the jury with your skills! It is mportant to know that this contest is focused on self-made outfits, and not who has bought the most beautiful costume. Note: this is not necessarily a cosplay competition, but we do not exclude cosplays.
