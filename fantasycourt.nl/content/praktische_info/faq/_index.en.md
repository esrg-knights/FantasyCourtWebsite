## **General**
### What is Fantasy Court?
Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival with a large variety of stalls, activities, and organizations that fall within the category of "fantasy". This includes Larp associations, themed board games, unusual foods, a Larp-swordfighting tournament, Larp-archery, and a large variety of merchants and artists, among others.

### Is cash needed/available at Fantasy Court?
Fantasy Court does not have an ATM/cash machine on-site. Many vendors accept both cash and card payments, but some can only accept one of the two. Please make sure you are prepared for this in advance with sufficient cash. The closest ATM is about a kilometer away (by foot) on the Kruisstraat. 

### How do we keep Fantasy Court free for visitors?
We have a group of loyal volunteers from the [Eindhovense Studenten Rollenspel Genootschap Knights of the Kitchen Table](https://kotkt.nl) (Eindhoven's roleplaying and board game association), whose blood, sweat, and tears make Fantasy Court possible. We have also been fortunate enough to receive a financial contribution in 2024 and 2025 from [StEHven](https://stehven.nl/en/en-home/), which allows us to pay for the facilities. Furthermore, we receive funds from the [Rabo Clubsupport](https://www.rabobank.nl/leden/clubsupport).

Starting last year, we have also begun offering our own merch at the festival info stand, which allows our visitors to support us directly!

### What kinds of stalls will be present at the festival?
We have a huge variety of stands each year. Among them are vendors who make fantasy clothing by hand, game vendors, and visual artists, but also much more! You can find a description of each stand on the [list of stalls]({{< ref "/programma_2025/kramen/" >}}) page.

## **Food, Drinks, and Facilities**
### Will there be food and drink available?
Food, drinks, and snacks are all available for purchase at various stalls within our market. Free tap water is also available, but you will need to bring your own bottle or cup.

### May I bring my own food and drinks?
It is permitted to bring food and drink for your own consumption.

### Is the festival wheelchair accessible?
Fantasy Court takes place on a flat, grassy field (with some possibility of mud if it has recently rained). As long as this is not an issue, everything should be accessible for wheelchair users. There will be a wheelchair-accessible outhouse toilet.

### Where is the emergency kit?
The EHBO (emergency first aid) kit will be present at the Fantasy Court info stand. Fantasy Court volunteers will always be present at the stand to provide first aid equipment if needed. We will also have BHVers (people authorized to do emergency first aid) present on the field at all times, with the lead BHVer recognizable by their neon vest.

## **Costume contest and swordfighting tournament**
### How do I participate in the LARP-swordfighting tournament?
You can sign up on-site at the Fantasy Court info stand. Reserving a spot to participate in the tournament works on a first-come, first-serve basis, so be sure to go by the info stand and sign up as soon as you arrive at the festival.

### What are the rules for the swordfighting tournament?
The tournament works on an elimination bracket system, composed of one-on-one duels limited to two minutes each. An overview of the rules can be found on the [Activities page]({{< ref "programma_2025/activiteiten/">}}), but a printout will also be available to review at the tournament location.

### How do I participate in the costume contest?
Due to the very large interest last year, participants this year must sign up in advance. The details will be available later.

### What are the rules of the costume contest?
The costume contest is open to all ages. You can participate in any outfit or costume that you have personally made or composed. Our own grand jury will judge the costumes. Self-made costume pieces will be judged favorably, and the jury will collectively decide the winner.
You can find an overview of the rules on the [Activities page]({{< ref "programma_2025/activiteiten/">}}).

## **Other**

### May I take photos at Fantasy Court?
Definitely! We love when people take photos at our event. We will be even happier if you also send them to us at [pictures@fantasycourt.nl](mailto:pictures@fantasycourt.nl). We may even share some of them on our own social media pages.

### Can I store my personal items somewhere?
We unfortunately do not offer a place for visitors to store their items.

### Can I get into costume on site?
We do not have designated changing rooms at the festival.

### I have lost something at the festival! Where can I find it if someone turns it in?
Found items will be stored at the Fantasy Court info stand.

### May I bring my pet to Fantasy Court?
Bringing pets to the festival is permitted as long as they remain on-leash. Of course, please clean up after your pet. If the pet causes damage, the organization may need to ask you to leave the festival.

### May I come to Fantasy Court dressed up?
Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend Fantasy Court in costume, cosplay, or historical clothing. Please make sure that your costume is acceptable to wear in a public space where children will also be present.

### May I bring a (larp-)sword to Fantasy Court?
Bringing foam larp swords to Fantasy Court is permitted. You may fight using foam props in the *designated areas*. Each person is responsible for maintaining the safety of their own foam props up to standard. The organization may perform a safety check on any person's props at any time and ask unsafe props to be removed from the festival area. The safety rules for larp fighting (see the bottom of this page) apply to any duel or sparring that occurs at the festival, so please keep them in mind at all times.

Carrying or fighting with hard wooden, metal, or plasic weapons is not permitted, and neither is carrying highly realistic looking larp weapons. Fantasy Court takes place in a public area, so we must comply with regular weapon laws. Knives or other weapons purchased at the festival must remain in their packaging for the duration of the festival.

The golden rule is ”don't do anything that forces us to make our weapon rules stricter”. Use common sense and do not push boundaries so that we can all continue to enjoy the current freedoms.

#### Safety Rules for LARP Fighting
1. No stabbing with LARP props.
2. It is not permitted to strike at the head, neck or crotch.
3. Physical contact between people is forbidden at all times during a battle.
4. Hold back your blows, i.e., do not strike with full force.
5. It is not permitted to run during a duel.
6. It is not permitted to strike others with a shield.
7. Please be extra careful when striking the chest, or wrists, as these areas are permitted to strike but may also be more painful.
8. You may use overhand or understand strikes, but remember again to avoid the head and be careful with strikes to the crotch.
