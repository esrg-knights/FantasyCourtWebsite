FAQ FC
## General
###  Wat is Fantasy Court? 
Fantasy Court is a fantasy festival with a vast array of stalls, associations, and activities that all fall under the purview of the awesome world of fantasy. This would entail LARP associations, surprising board games, exotic foods, a LARP sword fighting tournament, LARP sword fighting for kids, storytellers, a LARP archery range as well as a wide variety of stalls that sell anything related. 

###  Can I withdraw money at Fantasy Court? 
We do not provide that option. Many vendors take both cash and card, while others only take cash or card. Please plan ahead. 
###  How do you keep Fantasy Court free?
We have a bunch of lovely volunteers from the Knights of the Kitchen Table whose blood, sweat and tears help us make Fantasy Court a reality each year! They facilitate the event by arranging the field from the TU/e. Lastly, StEHven has been a proud sponsor of Fantasy Court since 2024 and provided financial aid to help organize the festival and keep it free.
