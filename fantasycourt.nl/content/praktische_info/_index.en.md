## Am I allowed to go to Fantasy Court in Costume?
You are welcome to visit fantasy court in costume, cosplay or period clothing, or just your regular clothing. Please have a proper amount of skin coverage for public display. Please do not be the reason we have to adjust this policy to be more strict.

## Can I change clothes on location?
We do not provide dressing rooms.

## Am I allowed to bring a (larp) sword to Fantasy Court?.
You are allowed to carry a foam larp sword to fantasy court. 

Fighting with foam weapons is allowed on *the designated spots* in the tournament field and at the edge of the festival. People are responsible for the safety of their personal larp swords. The organization is at all times allowed to check larp-swords and request people to remove unsafe swords from the area. Always keep in mind the fighting safely rules.

Carrying and fighting with hard wood, metal or plastic weapons is not allowed. As is carrying "real looking" weapons. Fantasy court takes place on public terrain so follow the weapon laws. This also concerns knives and other weapons bought at the festival which have to be kept sealed in their packaging.  

The golden rule is “don't do anything that forces us to be more strict”. Use your common sense and do not push the boundaries so we don't have to do that ourselves.

### Fighting safely rules
1. Stabbing with the weapons is prohibited.
2. It is not allowed to hit the head or the neck.
3. Physical contact is not allowed.
4. Participants have to swing with reservation and make sure your sword will swing at the opponent and not through them.
5. Running is not allowed. The tourney field is small enough that it's unnecessary and it can cause accidents.
6. Shield-bashing is not allowed.
7. Although they do count as valid hit locations we ask you to avoid hitting the groin, breasts, and wrists of the opponent since these body parts can hurt quite a bit.
8. We do allow for upward and downward attacks. Be careful to not hit the head of the groin with these though.

## Am I allowed to bring a pet to Fantasy Court?
Pets are allowed on the campus terrain as long as they are leashed. Please clean up after your pets. If the pet is causing a disturbance the organization can ask you to leave the festival.


## Is the festival wheelchair accessible?
Fantasy Court does take place outside on a grass field, but all stalls are accessible for wheelchair users. We will have a wheelchair accessible chemical toilet.

## Where can I find a first aid kit?
At the Fantasy Court booth. There should always be at least two volunteers at the booth. You can recognize us by our Fantasy Court flag.

## How can I participate in the Swordfight Tournament
Last year you could sign up for the tournament at the fantasy court booth before the start. Note that we have a limited amount of spaces.

## What are the rules of the swordfight tournament?
The safety rules can be found above. The exact rules can be found at the Info booth. The tournament will consist of duels in an elimination format with a two minute time limit.

## How can I participate in the Costume Contest
Because of the large number of participants last year we are going to require sign-ups beforehand. More details will follow soon.

## What are the rules of the Costume Contest?
The Costume Contest is free to enter for all ages. You are free to come in a design of your own, or to join in a cosplay. Our esteemed jury will take a close look at your homemade creations and will crown a winner. Homemade being the key term, as it is a craft competition.

Please have a proper amount of skin coverage for public display. Please do not be the reason we have to adjust this policy to be more strict.
