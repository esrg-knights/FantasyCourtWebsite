# Practical Information

## Edition 2025
Welcome to Fantasy Court 2025! This edition of the festival will take place on June 8 in Eindhoven on the TU/e campus, from 11:00 to 18:00! As soon as the information is made public, you will be able to find an overview of our program, the registered vendors and organizations, and a list of activites on the [Programme page]({{< ref "/programma_2025" >}}). To help you find your way here, we have also included some more practical info:

## Facilities
There are a number of food stalls at the event. There is also a tap for free water nearby (but no free cups, so bring your own mug or bottle). There will be a mobile toilet unit set up at the event, including a large stall for those with mobility aids or large costumes.

## Location and Parking
The event is on a field with no individual address on the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) campus. The navigation address for the event and the nearby parking lot is: **Den Dolech 12, 5613 AZ, Eindhoven**. Fantasy Court is slightly to the south of this point, at the following coordinates: 51.447228696063085, 5.484236714828935

We are just a few minutes' walk to the northeast from the train- and bus station **Eindhoven Centraal**. Some small directional signs will also be set up on and near the campus.

**Parking at the TU/e campus** is free only for the first 30 minutes, and costs €0.50 per 15 minutes beyond that, up to a maximum of €7.50 in one day. **Off-campus parking** is free on the _Rachelsmolen_ or along the nearby parallel road _Onze Lieve Vrouwestraat_.

### Larp-swords at Fantasy Court 
Carrying foam larp swords at Fantasy Court is permitted. Visitors may fight, duel, and spar using foam larp props at the *designated spots* on the tournament field and around the border of the site. Each person is responsible for the safety of their own larp props. The event organizers may at any time check foam props and ask for unsafe items to be removed from the site. Anyone participating in larp battles must take the safety rules (see below) into account.

Carrying or fighting with hard wooden, metal, or plastic weapons is not permitted, and neither is carrying very realistic larp prop weapons. Fantasy Court is held in a public area, and thus must comply with local laws concerning weaponry. Knives or other weapons purchased on site must remain in packaging at all times.

The golden rule is ”don't do anything that forces us to make our weapon policy stricter”. Use common sense, and don't push the boundaries of the festival rules. Only in this way can we all continue to enjoy the current level of freedom.


#### Safety Rules for LARP Battles
1. No stabbing with LARP props.
2. It is not permitted to strike at the head or neck.
3. Physical contact between people is forbidden at all times during a battle.
4. Hold back your blows, i.e., do not strike with full force.
5. It is not permitted to run during a duel.
6. It is not permitted to strike others with a shield.
7. Please be extra careful when striking the crotch, chest, or wrists, as these areas are permitted to strike but may also be more painful.
8. You may use overhand or understand strikes, but remember again to avoid the head and be careful with strikes to the crotch.
